1.  To start off this exercise, we are going to close off our TrainingApp, and we are going
    to create another app. This time with the Google Maps Activity.

2.  Start by going to File -> Select "New" -> "New Project..."

3.  Next, select the "Google Maps Activity" template.

    Click "Next".

    Change the Name of the application to "MapExample"

    Select API 26 as the minimum API level.

    Click "Finish"

4.  Once our project files is created & the build is done, Android Studio will automatically 
    open up two files:

    (a) google_maps_api.xml
    (b) MapsActivity.java

    Within google_maps_api.xml, there will be instructions on how to get the API key from 
    Google Maps.

    When you launch the unique url in the web browser, select "Create a Project" in the first
    step.

    Next step, click  on "Create API key".

    Next, copy and paste that API key to the <string name="google_maps_key">[Value]</string>
    value within the google_maps_api.xml file.

5.  Next, let's take a look at how we can get a location and putting a marker on it. The
    good thing about this example is that it already has the basic example, all we have to do
    is make a few changes in the onMapReady() method:

    // Add a marker in Bedok MRT Station and move the camera
    val bedokMrt = LatLng(1.3240113, 103.9279838)
    mMap.addMarker(MarkerOptions().position(bedokMrt).title("Marker in Bedok"))
    mMap.moveCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLng(bedokMrt))

6.  You could actually program the Android app to dynamically detect location, however for
    today's workshop, we will not be diving into that part.
